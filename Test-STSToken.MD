# PowerShell Script Explanation

This PowerShell Test-STSToken script is designed to retrieve the security token for each web application in a SharePoint farm. 

## Breakdown

1. **CmdletBinding:** The script uses a `CmdletBinding` attribute which allows it to be used like a cmdlet, a lightweight command used in PowerShell. This includes features like parameter binding and the use of common parameters like `-Verbose`, `-Debug`, etc.

2. **Parameters:** This script does not take any parameters, as indicated by the empty `param()` function.

3. **Process Block:** The main functionality of the script is enclosed in the `process` block. This block is executed once for every input item if the script is used as a cmdlet.

4. **Try-Catch Block:** The script uses a try-catch block to handle potential errors. The `try` block contains the code that may cause an exception, and the `catch` block contains the code to handle the exception.

5. **Loading SharePoint PowerShell Snap-in:** The script uses the `Add-PSSnapin` cmdlet to load the `Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell` snap-in, which provides the functionality to interact with SharePoint.

6. **Accessing SharePoint Farm:** It accesses the local SharePoint farm using `[Microsoft.SharePoint.Administration.SPFarm]::Local`.

7. **Creating SharePoint Web Services Collection:** It creates a collection of SharePoint web services using `New-Object Microsoft.SharePoint.Administration.SPWebServiceCollection`.

8. **Iterating through Web Services:** The script then iterates through each web service in this collection.

9. **Iterating through Web Applications:** For each web service, the script iterates through its web applications.

10. **Retrieving Response URI:** For each web application, the script retrieves the response URI for the default zone using the `GetResponseUri` method.

11. **Retrieving Security Token:** It then calls the `SecurityTokenForContext` method to retrieve the security token for the retrieved context.

12. **Output:** For each web application, the script outputs a custom object with the web application context and the security token.

13. **Error Handling:** If any error occurs, the error message is caught and displayed as a warning message using `Write-Warning`.
